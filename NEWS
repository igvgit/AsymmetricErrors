Version 0.7 - development

* Removed "examples" directory. All usage is now from the Python wrapper.

* Added a number of log likelihood models: MoldedQuartic, MatchedQuintic,
  InterpolatedSeptic, etc.

* Added class DistributionLogli to create log likelihood models from
  distribution models. Added static functions "fromModeAndDeltas"
  to a variety of distribution models, needed for the same purpose.

* Added class "QVWGaussian". Added back Edgeworth expansions with just
  three cumulants. The class is now called "EdgeworthExpansion3".

* Added classes "DoubleCubicGaussian" and "SymmetricBetaGaussian".

* Added class "TabulatedDensity1D" to represent densities utilizing
  linear interpolation.

* Added some new methods to AbsDistributionModel1D and all derived
  classes.

* Added static bool "isFullOPAT" to all distribution models in order to
  distinguish distributions that can be used as models for arbitrary
  OPAT outcomes (including shifts of the same sign) and that have
  a standard constructor from mu, sigmaPlus, and sigmaMinus.

* Added methods "posteriorMean" and "posteriorVariance" to the
  log-likelihood curves.

* Various small fixes.


Version 0.6 - August 1 2023, by I. Volobouev

* Added class "InterpolatedDensity1D".


Version 0.5 - July 22 2023, by I. Volobouev

* Added class "LikelihoodAccumulator".

* Added class "RailwayGaussian".

* Removed class "EdgeworthExpansion" for now. It is very difficult
  to ensure that the density does not get negative.

* Added methods "fromQuantiles" to various distribution classes.

* Added determination of maximum entropy kurtosis to Johnson systems.

* Added factories for distribution classes and likelihood curves.

* Added a number of mathematical utilities.


Version 0.4 - July 13 2023, by I. Volobouev

* Added a base class for handling log-likelihood curve shifting and scaling.

* Implemented a number of log-likelihood curves from arXiv:physics/0406120v1.


Version 0.3 - July 10 2023, by I. Volobouev

* Added 6th degree polynomial term to the Edgeworth expansion density
  (and corresponding term to cdf).

* Added the abstract base class for the log-likelihood curves and
  an implementation with a cubic Hermite spline on a regular grid.


Version 0.2 - July 4 2023, by I. Volobouev

* Added constructors from cumulants to all density models.

* Added numerical convolutions.


Version 0.1 (just a partial prototype) - July 1 2023, by I. Volobouev

* This version contains, basically, implementations of various univariate
  statistical distributions which "slightly" differ from the Gaussian.
  The relevant header file is "ase/DistributionModels1D.hh". The following
  classes are currently implemented: Gaussian, DimidatedGaussian,
  DistortedGaussian, SkewNormal, LogNormal, JohnsonSu, JohnsonSb,
  JohnsonSystem, EdgeworthExpansion, and EmpiricalDistribution (the
  last one is useful for testing and visualization purposes).
