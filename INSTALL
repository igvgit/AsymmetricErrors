A typical "ase" package installation can proceed as follows:

./configure --disable-static --with-pic
make
make install

The last step may have to be performed as root. Run

./configure --help

to view available configuration options.

Note that, before installing, you can set the PKG_CONFIG_PATH
environment variable to the name of the directory where you want
the package configuration file "ase.pc" to be installed. This is
necessary if the location of this directory is unconventional.
