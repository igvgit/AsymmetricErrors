# AsymmetricErrors
Distributions and log-likelihoods for modeling asymmetric errors.
This code accompanies the "Asymmetric Errors" paper by R. Barlow,
A.R. Brazzale, and I. Volobouev. Download the file ase-X.Y.tar.gz
(where X.Y stands for the version number, 0.7 at the time of this
writing) and then follow the instructions in the [INSTALL](./INSTALL)
file. The intended use of this package is through its
[Python API](https://github.com/igvgit/AsymmetricErrorsPy).
